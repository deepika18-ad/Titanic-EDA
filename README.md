Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Titanic Dataset

# Titanic Dataset – Exploratory Data Analysis

## Project Overview
This Mini project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset to understand passenger characteristics and survival patterns.

## Dataset
- Dataset: Titanic (GeeksforGeeks)
- Rows: ~891
- Columns: Passenger details such as Age, Sex, Fare, Pclass, Survived

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib
- Pycharm and Juypter Notebook

## Steps Performed
- Data Collection
- Data Understanding
- Missing value handling
- Univariate analysis
- Bivariate analysis
- Outlier detection using IQR method
- Data Visualization

## Key Insights
- Females had higher survival rates than males
- First-class passengers had better survival chances
- Fare contains many outliers due to right-skewed distribution

## Project Files
- `Titanic_eda.ipynb` – Jupyter Notebook with full analysis
- `train.csv` – Dataset used

## Conclusion
This analysis helped understand important survival trends and data quality issues in the Titanic dataset.
